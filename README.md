# Compound V2 Wallet Risk Scoring 

## Overview

This project scores 100 wallet addresses based on their transaction history on the Compound V2 protocol. Each wallet receives a **risk score between 0 and 1000**, where a lower score indicates riskier or bot-like behavior, and a higher score indicates healthy borrowing/lending activity.

## 📊 Architecture & Processing Flow

1. **Input:**  
   - `wallets.txt` contains 100 wallet addresses (one per line).
   - Simulated transaction data is used to represent typical Compound behaviors.

2. **Step 1 - Data Collection:**  
   - `fetch_transactions.py` simulates fetching Compound transaction history and creates `transactions.csv`.

3. **Step 2 - Feature Engineering:**  
   - `feature_engineering.py` reads `transactions.csv` and generates `wallet_features.csv` with:
     - Total supply, borrow, repay, redeem amounts
     - Ratios (repay/borrow, redeem/supply)
     - Token diversity

4. **Step 3 - Risk Scoring:**  
   - `score_wallets.py` computes a risk score based on engineered features.
   - Final outputs:
     - `wallet_scores.csv`
     - `score_distribution.png` (visual histogram of scores)

## 🧠 Methodology

Scoring is based on:
- **Repayment behavior** — higher repay/borrow ratio = safer
- **Redemption behavior** — lower redeem/supply = healthier usage
- **Diversity** — using more tokens = more natural user
- **Volume of supply** — higher = better

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python fetch_transactions.py
python feature_engineering.py
python score_wallets.py

> ⚠️ Note:
> The `fetch_transactions.py` script is included for completeness, but currently does **not** fetch live data from the Compound V2 subgraph as the data endpoint is deprecated or inaccessible.
>
> For the purpose of this assignment, the `transactions.csv` has been manually created using simulated or sample data derived from wallet addresses. You can proceed with `feature_engineering.py` and `score_wallets.py` using this file.
